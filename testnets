Testnets still cost GAS fees. Faucets offer free testnet tokens to pay for GAS fees but receiving these often means holding mainnet tokens. 

E.g if you want to use the Binance faucet for tBNB tokens, you need a minimum BNB holding of at least 0.02 BNB on a mainnet to receive free tBNB tokens for testnet GAS fees. 

My initial thought is that this is interesting as testnets with a lot of users developing, with this policy/requirement, might purchase the main currency in order to use testnet faucets or use/develop on the testnet. 

Maybe there is opportunity here to explore relationships between user numbers/user growth on testnets and price of the mainnet currencie for alpha. Perhaps someting predictable.
