#Warnings

## 1. 

This is a warning from Metamask whilst setting up the Binance BNB network. I set this up to receive tBNB from the Binnaace faucet, to pay for gas fees on BNB and custom networks running on BNB. 

```
Keep in mind:
Gas is BNB
The native token on this network is BNB. It is the token used for gas fees.
Bridge, don't send
You may lose your assets if you try to send them from another network. Transfer funds safely between networks by using a bridge.
Adding tokens
Your tokens may not automatically show up in your wallet. You can always add tokens manually.
```

Embarassingly, when I was 15 I accidentally tried to send ETH to a BTC wallet. I expect it never arrived because I didn't use, and wasn't aware I had to use a bridge. Since, I understand why. 

A crypto bridge, also known as a cross-chain connector, is a protocol that allows users to transfer assets and data between different blockchains.

What I learnt: 
  -Amongst scams and real threats, our own lack of understanding is also a threat to ourselves.
  -Safety is a personal responsibility. The need to remain safe is a need to learn and understand what we are doing. 


## 2. testnet tokens can be named anything - verification is needed by comparing the details of the token as tokens can be spoofed by name only. Token Contract (WITH 18 Decimals)

Etherscan and associated scans such as BSCscan can be used to get information about a token and verify authenticity

You can remain safe by: 

```
Double-checking the network name
Verifying the chain ID
Ensuring the RPC URL is correct
Confirming the currency symbol matches the expected network
```
