Crypto staking involves committing your cryptocurrency tokens to support a blockchain network and confirm transactions.

It's available for cryptocurrencies that use the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which is more energy-efficient than the proof-of-work model used by Bitcoin. 

This earns money on the tokens staked. Some crypto projects require staking in order to participate and to use smart contracts on that chain.
